# dataset-pre-processing

Pre-processing of popular datasets (mostly UCI from repositories). The methods include:

- One-hot-encoding of categorical variables
- Min-max-scaling of numerical variables into the range [0, 1]
- Generating metadata information:
  - Number of samples
  - Number of features
  - Variable types
  - One-hot-encoding dictionaries
  - Min-max-scaling limits
  - Class names
  
 Scripts for downloading datasets and pre-processing them with default parameters are also included.
